Movie Schema - Each movie document contains information about a specific movie including its title, year, etc.
Users can add movies they would like to watch or when the selector chooses a movie for the user
based on their preference (year, director, top 250 movies), they can add it to the list of movies they would like to watch.

var Movie = new mongoose.Schema() {
    title:String,
    year:String,
    direction:String,
    tagline: String,
    rating: Number
    funFact: String
}

    title:String,
    year:String,
    numOfSeasons: String,
    tagline: String,
    rating: Number
    funFact: String
}

User Schema - contains information about the user that is using the website and their movie
and series preference

var User = new mongoose.Schema() {

    password: String,
    age:String,
    statistics: Stats,
    email: String,
    movies:[Movie],
    series: [Series]
}

Stats schema keeps track of user statistics, which includes the total number of items that they have
selected to watch, whether this item is movie or tv-series. Statistics is also kept on which genre
